    "\n",
    "In the [previous notebook](https://github.com/monash-emu/summer/blob/master/docs/textbook/01-basic-model.ipynb), we introduced our general approach to creating and running a simple compartmental model of the transmission of an acute immunising infection. This basic model had only three compartments, which were linked together by two transition flows, with one additional flow through which the population simulated could exit the system (deaths). However, there are several epidemiological issues to consider when adding flows to the compartmental structure, and many different types of flow we might want to apply to our compartments.\n",

    "Note that this is a somewhat \"non-traditional\" way of thinking about compartmental models, which are more often represented as ODEs (as mentioned in notebook 01). When defined in this way, a \"flow\" can be thought of an entry to or exit from a compartment, that increments/decrements the value of that compartment at a certain rate and is indicated with an addition/subtraction term in the ODE for that compartment. Each entry/exit to/from a compartment may have a corresponding exit/entry from/to a linked compartment. However, we believe that modellers more often think in terms of \"compartments\" linked by \"flows\", which is also reflected in the common illustration of such systems through flow diagrams.\n",
