    "# Basic model construction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The objective of this first notebook is to introduce the _summer_ interface \n",
    "that we will use throughout this series,\n",
    "use it to demonstrate the construction of a simple model,\n",
    "and demonstrate several principles of infectious disease modelling.\n",
    "Because this is the first notebook/chapter, \n",
    "there is slightly more content in this notebook introducing the code packages we will be using.\n",
    "Although the model is so simple that we could actually write this system even more tersely,\n",
    "we'll also try to use good coding habits from the outset.\n",
    "Also, we'll immediately come back to some of the features of our simple model in the following notebooks,\n",
    "including thinking more about flows and how we obtain numerical solutions for our system.\n",
    "In our example model, we will create an SIR compartmental model for a general, unspecified, immunising infectious disease spreading through a fully susceptible population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model there will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Three compartments, named `susceptible`, `infectious` and `recovered`\n",
    "- A starting population of 1000 people, with 10 of them infected (and infectious)\n",
    "- An evaluation timespan from day zero to 20 units of time\n",
    "- Inter-compartmental flows for infection, death and recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "As with any Python script, we first have to import the objects we need,\n",
    "plus we'll set the visualisation of pandas objects to be interactive.\n",
    "You'll see similar cells to these in all the notebooks in the series."

    "we will be using it for - or the epidemiological question that we will be addressing through our analysis.\n",

    "features - with a reasonable level of confidence that we are actually capturing the processes that we are interested in\n",
    "(including empiric data to estimate the parameters that we need to build our more complicated model).\n",
    "\n",

    "- Very broadly, this model gives us the shape that epi curves often follow - looking vaguely like a bell\n",
    "- There is an exponential growth phase when the population remains largely susceptible\n",
    "- The growth in the epidemic decreases as the proportion of susceptibles decreases\n",
    "- As the effective reproduction number falls past one, the epidemic peaks and begins to decline\n",
    "- The epidemic dies out as the susceptibles decrease and the effective reproduction number drops below one\n",
    "- As the epidemic ends and transmission declines to approximately zero, susceptibles are depleted, but not completely - a proportion of the population remains susceptible even after the epidemic\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think of some of the epidemiological features that this model **does not** capture:\n",
    "- Any heterogeneity in the background population with regards progression through infection states after exposure\n",
    "- Any heterogeneity in transmission, such as greater transmission to people within the population with similar characteristics\n",
    "- Any heterogeneity in the pathogen, such as multiple strains with different characteristics circulating through the population\n",
    "- Any changes in how people transition through their stages over time that might be induced through changes external to the model\n",
    "(i.e. other than those related to the changes in the population distribution across compartments resulting from transmission of this immunising pathogen)\n",
    "- Tracking any outputs other than the sizes of the model's compartments\n",

    "We will return to these features and how to elaborate our base model to capture them over the following notebooks."
