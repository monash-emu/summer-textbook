    "## Introduction\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to introduce the _summer_ interface \n",
    "that we will use throughout this series of notebooks,\n",
    "use it to demonstrate the construction of a simple model,\n",
    "and demonstrate several principles of infectious disease modelling.\n",
    "Because this is the first notebook/chapter, \n",
    "there is a little more content in this notebook introducing the code packages we will be using through the series.\n",
    "In the following example, we will create an SIR compartmental model for a general, unspecified, immunising infectious disease spreading through a fully susceptible population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model there will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Three compartments, named `susceptible`, `infectious` and `recovered`\n",
    "- A starting population of 1000 people, with 10 of them infected (and infectious)\n",
    "- An evaluation timespan from day zero to 20 units of time\n",
    "- Inter-compartmental flows for infection, deaths and recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "As with any Python script, we first have to import the objects we need,\n",
    "plus we'll set the visualisation of pandas objects to be interactive."

    "### Ordinary differential equation for the infectious compartment\n",
    "In developing `summer`, we have aimed to move away from notating our models in ODEs\n",
    "and we will generally avoid ODE notation throughout this textbook.\n",
    "This is because the `summer` API is intended to support code that is highly expressive,\n",
    "such that the epidemiological intention can be easily gleaned from reading the code itself.\n",
    "Therefore, there should be less need for an alternative form of notation.\n",
    "Further, the ODEs used to notate epidemiological models\n",
    "do not constitute the code used in simulation,\n",
    "but rather the modellers intention for the construction of the system.\n",
    "Therefore, there is considerable potential for the ODEs to diverge from the underlying code,\n",
    "which is very common in our experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, for readers who are familiar with ODE notation,\n",
    "we present the following expression for the infectious compartment:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dI}{dS}=\\frac{\\beta S}{N}-(\\gamma + \\mu)I $$\n",
    "where the `infectious` and `susceptible` compartments \n",
    "are represented by $I$ and $S$ respectively,\n",
    "and the contact rate, `recovery` rate and `infection_death` rate\n",
    "are represented by $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ and $\\mu$ respectively.\n",
    "Note that the division by $N$ is handled behind the scenes by\n",
    "_summer_ after the user requested frequency-dependent transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latent period versus incubation period\n",
    "The latent period is the time from infection to the onset of infectiousness.\n",
    "In this simple model, there is no delay between infection and infectiousness,\n",
    "such that the latent period is zero.\n",
    "By contrast, the incubation period is the time from infection to symptom onset.\n",
    "Symptoms are not explicitly represented in this model\n",
    "(and model structure to represent symptom status may only be necessary\n",
    "if symptoms lead to some epidemiological change, \n",
    "such as through case isolation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sojourn times\n",
    "The average infectious period in this model is the reciprocal of the sum of the recovery rate and the death rate.\n",
    "This is because, for a given person entering the `infectious` compartment,\n",
    "there are two ways to exit the compartment,\n",
    "so the total rate of leaving the compartment is the sum of these two flow rates.\n",
    "In other words, when considering the `infectious` compartment\n",
    "in the absence of any inward flows,\n",
    "the _per capita_ rate of exiting the compartment is the sum of the two flow rates.\n",
    "If these rates remain constant over time and in the absence of inward flows,\n",
    "the size of the compartment at time $t$ is given by:\n",
    "$$ e ^{-outflows \\times t} $$\n",
    "and the average time in the compartment is given by:\n",
    "$$ \\int_0^\\infty e ^{-outflows \\times t} dt $$\n",
    "which is equal to:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{outflows} $$\n",
    "This can also be termed the \"sojourn time\" of the compartment.\n",
    "(Note that this does not imply that half of the population \n",
    "will have left the `infectious` category after one sojourn time.)\n",
    "In this model the sojourn time for the `infectious` compartment is therefore:"

    "### Risks from rates\n",
    "Often in epidemiology,\n",

    "For example, we may want to know what the risk of death is\n",
    "for a person entering the `infectious` compartment in our simple model.\n",
    "In this case, there are only two possibly outcomes which are applied\n",

    "- Very broadly, this model does give us the shape that epi curves often follow - looking vaguely like a bell\n",

    "- As the epidemic ends and transmission declines to approximately zero, susceptibles are depleted, but not completely - a proportion of the population remains susceptible even after the epidemic\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think of some of the epidemiological features that this model **_does not_** capture:\n",
    "- Any heterogeneity in the background population with regards progression through infection states after exposure\n",
    "- Any heterogeneity in transmission, such as greater transmission to people within the population with similar characteristics\n",

    "The terminology for this type of model is that we are simulating an \"open\" population,\n",
