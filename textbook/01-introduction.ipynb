    "# Infectious disease (ID) modelling\n",
    "ID modelling is a fascinating field that spans many disciplines.\n",
    "The field can be thought of an extension of infectious disease epidemiology,\n",
    "complex systems analysis or mathematics, \n",
    "such that modellers come a broad range of backgrounds, including science, engineering,\n",
    "mathematics, clinical medicine and public health.\n",
    "Despite this, there are relatively few courses available in the discipline\n",
    "and essentially no coursework degrees dedicated to the area.\n",
    "Moreover, there is considerable potential for greater integration of the\n",
    "ID modelling with the burgeoning field of data science,\n",
    "which this textbook seeks to leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do we mean by ID modelling?\n",
    "Many forms of \"modelling\" can be used to shed light on aspects of various infectious diseases.\n",
    "Any simpler system that provides insight into the pathogen or \n",
    "infectious disease we are interested in can be referred to as a model.\n",
    "For example, infecting a mouse with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and examining the\n",
    "pathological features that are generated as a consequence of the infection is a \"model\" of human infectious disease.\n",
    "Similarly, statistical modelling is commonly used to understand a range of diseases,\n",
    "including infectious diseases, but is distinct from the models we consider here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This textbook is directed at models consisting of **mechanistic simulations** of\n",
    "infectious disease transmission.\n",
    "That is, we are interested in computational simulations that explicitly represent\n",
    "the mechanisms underlying the system of interest.\n",
    "Whereas statistical modelling may identify relationships between risk factors \n",
    "and clinical outcomes of interest, \n",
    "it does not necessarily provide any insights into the reasons underlying these relationships.\n",
    "That is, statistical modelling might address the question:\n",
    "_\"What is the association between risk factor A and disease outcome B?\"_,\n",
    "whereas mechanistic modelling could additionally address the question:\n",
    "_\"Why is this association present?\"_ and \n",
    "_\"What are the underlying epidemiological drivers responsible for this association?\"_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can ID modelling help us?\n",
    "Modelling can help us answer questions that cannot be explored in other ways.\n",
    "For example, predicting the trajectory of an epidemic that hasn't occurred yet\n",
    "under various assumptions about how we should could respond to the epidemic.\n",
    "This is called \"scenario analysis\" and can also be undertaken retrospectively\n",
    "to consider past \"counterfactuals\".\n",
    "In this case, we might estimate an epidemic's dynamics under an alternative\n",
    "past that never occurred.\n",
    "These are probably the first uses of ID models that would occur to many of us.\n",
    "However, even the construction of a model itself can be an extremely useful exercise,\n",
    "because it challenges us to think about how transmission is taking place,\n",
    "what quantities might be important to the epidemic's dynamics\n",
    "and what additional information we might need to obtain to gain greater insight.\n",
    "Along these lines, if we have a certain intuition about how an epidemic is likely to progress,\n",
    "a model can help us to challenge and understand our own reasons for coming to that conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is ID modelling so different?\n",
    "While there is doubtless some overlap between other types of simulation models\n",
    "(e.g. non-communicable disease models) and ID models, \n",
    "there are also important differences.\n",
    "The fundamental distinction arises from the positive feedback loop present in the system,\n",
    "whereby the rate at which people become infected is driven by the number of\n",
    "infectious people in the population.\n",
    "This apparently minor consideration fundamentally changes the nature of the\n",
    "systems we are dealing with and draws us into the world of complex systems analysis.\n",
    "Note that these systems need not necessarily be highly complicated in order to be complex.\n",
    "For example, a model as simple as a three-compartment \"SIR\" (susceptible, infectious, recovered) \n",
    "infectious disease model can have dynamic behaviours that may be difficult to anticipate\n",
    "until we run the system forward in time to examine its behaviour.\n",
    "In systems such as this, or with a little additional complexity\n",
    "(e.g. allowing reinfection after recovery),\n",
    "we may be able to identify equilibrium points that the system will approach,\n",
    "and consider the effect of minor changes in perturbing this equilibrium point or points.\n",
    "This means that our models can exhibit us with counter-intuitive behaviours,\n",
    "whereby small changes to model inputs \n",
    "can have large or unanticipated consequences for the overall dynamics,\n",
    "drawing us into the field of complex systems analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use _summer_?\n",
    "_summer_ is a Python library that supports the construction of compartmental models of ID dynamics.\n",
    "A key objective of the _summer_ platform is to allow for the construction of \n",
    "models that may be both complex and complicated,\n",
    "while ensuring that they are reliably constructed, run quickly\n",
    "and allow the process of construction to be abstracted away from the user interface.\n",
    "In this series of notebooks, we illustrate several core features of ID modelling\n",
    "in the context of relatively simple models constructed with _summer_.\n",
    "However, these features can  easily be composed into more complicated models as needed\n",
    "to allow for the investigation of more complicated epidemic dynamics,\n",
    "such as specific public health interventions directed at the control of infectious diseases.\n",
    "The models that we (the Epidemiological Modelling Unit, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine,\n",
    "Monash University) typically use to produce research manuscripts and policy advice documents\n",
    "are more complicated than those introduced in this textbook.\n",
    "However, becoming familiar with _summer_'s syntax should faciliate the reader of this series\n",
    "to construct more complicated models suitable for more formal analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "Python has become the leading general purpose programming language in a broad range of fields,\n",
    "has a wide user community, extensive online support and an expressive and easily understood syntax.\n",
    "Commonly used Python libraries (such as pandas and numpy) are core tools and are hugely popular \n",
    "in fields that include data science and machine learning.\n",
    "Becoming familiar with Python and these commonly used libraries will facilitate the reader's future use of _summer_, \n",
    "but also will support the development of a range of skills rapidly transferable to other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this textbook is not\n",
    "In order to keep the focus of this textbook on infectious disease modelling,\n",
    "we do not aim to cover the following:\n",
    "- API documentation for _summer_, which can be found elsewhere\n",
    "- Comprehensive examples of how _summer_ methods can be implemented\n",
    "- An introduction to Python or other external Python libraries we use,\n",
    "for which online support is widely available\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, in this series, we aim to introduce good programming practices for\n",
    "the construction of _summer_-based models in Python,\n",
    "while also providing code that is terse and expressive."
