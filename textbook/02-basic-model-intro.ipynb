    "## Objective\n",
    "In this first notebook, we will use the _summer_ interface \n",
    "to demonstrate the construction of a simple model,\n",
    "and illustrate several principles of infectious disease modelling.\n",
    "Because this is the first notebook/chapter, \n",
    "there is slightly more code-related content in this chapter.\n",
    "We'll come back to some of the features of our simple model in the following notebooks,\n",
    "including thinking more about flows and how we obtain numerical solutions for our system.\n",
    "In our example model, we will create an SIR compartmental model for a general, unspecified, immunising infectious disease spreading through a fully susceptible population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model there will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Three compartments, named `susceptible`, `infectious` and `recovered`\n",
    "- A starting population of 1000 people, with 10 of them infected (and infectious)\n",
    "- An evaluation timespan from time zero to 20 units of time\n",
    "- Inter-compartmental flows for infection, death and recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Susceptible, infectious, recovered is a very commonly used model structure,\n",
    "although many variations on this exist,\n",
    "some of which will be explored in later notebooks.\n",
    "These compartments are commonly abbreviated to \"S\", \"I\" and \"R\",\n",
    "a convention which we will use in our diagrams.\n",
    "The recovered compartment is also commonly termed\n",
    "the \"removed\" compartment because the population in this compartment\n",
    "have no effect on transmission\n",
    "(except potentially through the total population size).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "As with any Python script, we first have to import the objects we need,\n",
    "plus we'll set the visualisation of pandas objects to be interactive.\n",
    "You'll see similar cells to these in all the notebooks in the series."
