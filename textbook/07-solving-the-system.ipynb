    "## Ordinary differential equation for the infectious compartment\n",
    "In developing `summer`, we have aimed to move away from notating our models in ODEs\n",
    "and we will generally avoid ODE notation throughout this textbook.\n",
    "This is because the `summer` API is intended to support code that is highly expressive,\n",
    "such that the epidemiological intention can be easily gleaned from reading the code itself.\n",
    "Therefore, there should be less need for an alternative form of notation.\n",
    "Further, the ODEs used to notate epidemiological models\n",
    "do not constitute the code used in simulation,\n",
    "but rather the modellers intention for the construction of the system.\n",
    "Therefore, there is considerable potential for the ODEs to diverge from the underlying code,\n",
    "which is very common in our experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, for readers who are familiar with ODE notation,\n",
    "we present the following expression for the infectious compartment of the model \n",
    "introduced in [notebook 02](./02-basic-model-intro.ipynb):\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dI(t)}{dt}=\\frac{\\beta S(t)}{N(t)}-\\gamma I(t) $$\n",
    "where the `infectious` and `susceptible` compartments \n",
    "are represented by $I$ and $S$ respectively,\n",
    "and the contact rate and `recovery` rate\n",
    "are represented by $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ respectively.\n",
    "Note that the division by $N(t)$ is handled behind the scenes by\n",
    "_summer_ through the user's request for frequency-dependent transmission."
