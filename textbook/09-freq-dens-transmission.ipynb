    "# Transmission assumptions\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll work through the assumptions underpinning\n",
    "frequency and density-dependent transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frequency dependence\n",
    "In previous chapters, \n",
    "we have been using the frequency-dependent transmission assumption.\n",
    "Under this assumption, the _per capita_ rate of transmission \n",
    "for an individual from the susceptible population is proportional\n",
    "to the **_prevalence_** of infectious persons in the population.\n",
    "We have been referring to the parameter used for this transition process as the `contact_rate`,\n",
    "in which case we can consider it as the _per capita_ rate at which\n",
    "a member of the population will come into effective contact \n",
    "with **_any_** other member of the population.\n",
    "Note that an \"effective\" contact is defined as a contact that would result in\n",
    "transmission were it to occur between a susceptible person and an infectious person.\n",
    "So the calculation of the rate of infection can be thoughts of as the product of:\n",
    "- The rate at which a person has effective contacts\n",
    "- The prevalence of infection in the population,\n",
    "i.e. the probability of an effective contact being with someone who is currently infected\n",
    "- The number of susceptibles,\n",
    "because we are working out the rate at which susceptibles are infected\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing against standard transition rates,\n",
    "we can think of the first two steps as the process of calculating the force of infection,\n",
    "which is equivalent to the transition rates we have been dealing with\n",
    "for other flows (except that it varies with the model state).\n",
    "By constrast, the last step is just multiplying through by the origin compartment as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also notate this frequency-dependent assumption mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\lambda (t) = \\beta \\frac{I(t)}{N(t)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda (t)$ represents the force of infection,\n",
    "$\\beta$ represents the rate of effective contacts per unit time,\n",
    "$I(t)$ the number of infectious persons in the population,\n",
    "$N(t)$ the total population size\n",
    "and $t$ time.\n",
    "The absolute rate of infection is therefore $\\lambda (t) S(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to the really simple SIR model from [notebook 02](./02-basic-model-intro.ipynb).\n",
    "We'll initially create a function that returns the model object without\n",
    "any transmission flows, so we can add the infection process we want later.\n",
    "Then we'll look at the outputs of our standard model as our starting point for comparisons\n",
    "to other assumptions in this notebook."
