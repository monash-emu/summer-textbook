    "### Frequency-dependent transmission\n",
    "This flow can be used to model infections using frequency-dependent disease transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple models like these (without adjustments of infectious status or other stratification features), \n",
    "the frequency-dependent infection flow rate (the number of people infected per time unit) can be thought of as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# contact_rate: Rate at which effective contact occurs\n",
    "# num_source: Number of people in the (susceptible) source compartment\n",
    "# num_infectious: Number of in the infectious compartment(s)\n",
    "# num_pop: Total number of people in the population\n",
    "force_of_infection = contact_rate * num_infectious / num_pop\n",
    "flow_rate = force_of_infection * num_source\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First note that once we have calculated the force of infection,\n",
    "we multiply this by the size of the source compartment\n",
    "(which we will often refer to as the susceptible population).\n",
    "So the force of infection can be thought of in a similar way to the parameter we apply in a transition flow.\n",
    "That is, the _per capita_ rate of transition from the source to the destination compartment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the force of infection, we have a parameter (`contact_rate`)\n",
    "and the proportion (prevalence) of infectious persons in the population\n",
    "(represented by the last two terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the force of infection formula into the formula for the flow rate and reordering, we can see that:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow_rate = contact_rate * num_infectious * num_source / num_pop\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here the last two terms of the equation together represent the proportion of the total population that is susceptible.\n",
    "Given that only contacts with susceptible people will result in transmission,\n",
    "the remaining proportion will be \"wasted\" from the perspective of the pathogen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this formula can be thought of as the number of infectious persons in the system,\n",
    "multiplied by the proportion of their contacts that are with susceptible persons,\n",
    "multiplied by some parameter.\n",
    "Given this understanding, the parameter can be thought of as the per unit time rate at which\n",
    "an infectious person comes into contact with other people in the population in such a way as it would result in transmission if that person was susceptible.\n",
    "This quantity is often referred to as the \"effective contact rate\",\n",
    "because it is the daily number of people that a member of this population will come into contact with other members of the population in such a way as it would result in transmission if the contact was between an infectious and a susceptible person."
