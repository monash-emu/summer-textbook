    "# Transmission assumptions\n",
    "In the previous chapters, \n",
    "we have been using frequency-dependent transmission assumption.\n",
    "Under this assumption, the rate of transmission is proportional\n",
    "to the number of susceptibles and the prevalence of infectious persons in the population.\n",
    "We have been referring to the parameter used for this transition process as the `contact_rate`,\n",
    "in which case we can consider this as the _per capita_ rate at which\n",
    "two specific individuals come into effective contact.\n",
    "Note that an effective contact can be defined as a contact that would result in\n",
    "transmission were it to occur between a susceptible person and an infectious person.\n",
    "Let's return to a really simple SIR model.\n",
    "In fact, even simpler than the one we introduced in notebook 02,\n",
    "because it doesn't even have an infection-related death flow.\n",
    "We'll initially create a function that returns the model object without\n",
    "any transmission flows, so we can add the process we want later."
