    "# The reproduction number\n",
    "The reproduction number is a key quantity in infectious disease modelling,\n",
    "which has major implications for epidemic dynamics.\n",
    "It represents the average number of secondary infectious persons resulting from a single infectious person.\n",
    "In modelling, we often consider both the time-varying reproduction ($R_{t}$)\n",
    "and the basic reproduction number ($R_{0}$).\n",
    "The former ($R_{t}$) represents the number of secondary infectious being produced at a time point\n",
    "in the epidemic or the simulation we are running,\n",
    "whereas the latter ($R_{0}$) represents the theoretical number of secondary\n",
    "infectious cases that would occur from a single infectious person in a fully susceptible population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic reproduction number is a useful way of conceptualising the overall infectiousness of a pathogen,\n",
    "and provides additional information to the \"contact rate\" that we have previously introduced.\n",
    "The key distinction is that the contact rate represents the number of secondary infections\n",
    "resulting **_per unit time_**, whereas the reproduction number is the number of secondary\n",
    "occurring infectious cases **_per infectious case_**."
