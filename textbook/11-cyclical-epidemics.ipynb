    "# Cyclical epidemic dynamics\n",
    "Both in models and in reality, we can observe regular cycles in\n",
    "the epidemiology of infectious disease outbreaks.\n",
    "As we saw in notebooks [02](./02-basic-model-intro.ipynb) \n",
    "and [10](./10-reproduction-number.ipynb),\n",
    "although the susceptible population is never depleted to zero,\n",
    "it is the depletion in susceptibles that leads \n",
    "to the epidemic slowing, declining and dying away.\n",
    "A consequence of this phenomenon is that if there is\n",
    "some process of replenishing the susceptible population,\n",
    "it is not inevitable that the epidemic will consistently decline.\n",
    "We saw a slight suggestion of this in [notebook 06](./06-immunity.ipynb),\n",
    "in which the SIRS model allowed for recovered persons\n",
    "to return to the susceptible pool.\n",
    "This led to a marginal resurgence in the epidemic\n",
    "within the analysis period we chose.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the rate of replenishment is very slow,\n",
    "the epidemic may have died away to lower levels of transmission\n",
    "by the time at which the susceptible population\n",
    "reaches the point at which the reproduction number ($R(t)$)\n",
    "increases above one and transmission begins to increase again.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if there is some process whereby susceptibles\n",
    "are replenished back into the population,\n",
    "there is the potential to observe cyclical epidemics\n",
    "even when model parameters remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Waning immunity model\n",
    "Let's see this in action,\n",
    "first with a similar model to the one that we have been using in several previous chapters,\n",
    "but with waning immunity incorporated at a very slow rate."
