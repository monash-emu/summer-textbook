    "but other than their mixing behaviours,\n",
    "these groups will have the same characteristics.\n",
    "To calculate the force of infection,\n",
    "we should take a row of the mixing matrix (e.g. the top row for `group1`)\n",
    "and multiply it through by the number of infectious people \n",
    "in each of our two strata.\n",
    "The values of the matrix therefore represent the rates\n",
    "at which two individuals from specific sub-groups come into effective contact.\n",
    "To keep the dynamics the same as for the unstratified version,\n",
    "we need to set our matrix to a $2 \\times 2$ matrix of ones,\n",
    "as we do within the loop below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frequency-dependent transmission, unstratified\n",

    "Here, although the force of infection calculation involves dividing through\n",
