    "# Population interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting assumptions\n",
    "So we've now laboriously got to the point that we should have\n",
    "some idea of what we are meaning by the mixing matrices\n",
    "that we might like to put into a model.\n",
    "But what to we really mean epidemiologically by\n",
    "different rates of contact between population groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have two population groups,\n",
    "and we want to consider that people from one population group\n",
    "just has less social activity than another\n",
    "and comes into contact with fewer people than the other one.\n",
    "If this is the way we're thinking,\n",
    "we really need a matrix to represent even this simple assumption,\n",
    "because contacts work in both directions.\n",
    "That is, if the susceptible individual from the one modelled group \n",
    "is less likely to be contacted by other individuals \n",
    "in the population because she/he is less socially active,\n",
    "then it is likely that she/he is also less likely to contact\n",
    "other persons in the population too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start looking at this under the density-dependent framework,\n",
    "because we're dealing with _per capita per capita_ rates \n",
    "considering both the susceptible and the infecting individual.\n",
    "In this case, we might like to consider that the rate at which \n",
    "the first population group contacts the second is the same as the rate\n",
    "at which the second contacts the first.\n",
    "Provided we are thinking of the contents of the mixing matrix as \n",
    "rates of contact per unit time, this is fine.\n",
    "If we also want to consider that one population group is more susceptible\n",
    "or more infectious than the other, we could do this by adjusting\n",
    "the infection flow rate (to change susceptibility) or\n",
    "the infectiousness of one of these categories,\n",
    "without adjusting the mixing matrix - \n",
    "or better yet, just assume everyone is equally susceptible and infectious.\n",
    "We can also take the risk of infection per contact idea out of the equation\n",
    "by thinking of the parameter for the infection transition rate \n",
    "as this quantity.\n",
    "That is, to keep things as simple as possible,\n",
    "let's think of our mixing matrix as containing information\n",
    "on the rate of social contact between the two specific population\n",
    "sub-groups we are simulating.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise, let's start off assuming:\n",
    "- Two interacting population subgroups\n",
    "- Density dependence\n",
    "- Uniform susceptibility and infectiousness\n",
    "- Our mixing matrix contains information on the rate of interaction between pairs of individuals from the two population subgroups\n",
    "represented by our matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assortative mixing\n",
    "A very common assumption in infectious disease modelling is that\n",
    "people in our population who share certain characteristics\n",
    "are more likely to come into contact with one-another \n",
    "than people who have different characteristics.\n",
    "For example, our two population groups might represent\n",
    "people living in two neighbouring towns,\n",
    "and we might want to consider that the rate at which\n",
    "people come into contact with other people from their own town\n",
    "is greater than the rate at which they come into contact with the other town.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a really simple matrix to represent this."
