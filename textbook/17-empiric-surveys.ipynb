    "(so people tend to associate most strongly with other people of the same age group)\n",
    "- There is a second, fainter peak in contacts that is loosely parallel to the diagonal\n",
    "of the matrix, but separated by about 30 years. This represents mixing\n",
    "between two successive generations (i.e. parents with their children and vice versa)\n",
    "- The most intense mixing appears to occur in children and young adults,\n",
    "although we'll go into that in more detail next\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is plenty to think about in terms of the implications\n",
    "for infectious disease transmission even before we incorporate\n",
    "these empiric data into our simulation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there is a bit of jiggle or random variability,\n",
    "as there will be with any empirically collected data,\n",
    "and these contact rates/patterns are highly dependent on the social characteristics\n",
    "of the setting that they have been collected from.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see from the graph below, \n",
    "that older children and young adults report the greatest number of contacts,\n",
