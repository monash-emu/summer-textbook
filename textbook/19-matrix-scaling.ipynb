    "Unfortunately, a lot of countries around the world have\n",
    "no empirically collected survey data on contact patterns,\n",
    "so we often have to infer from one setting to another.\n",
    "There are many different ways that we could do this,\n",
    "and the social interactions between population groups\n",
    "are likely highly dependent on many factors,\n",
    "including the age structure and composition of workplaces and schools,\n",
    "and a wide range of social and cultural factors.\n",
    "These factors are outside the scope of this series,\n",
    "but let's work through how we adjust only for differences in\n",
    "age structure between the setting in which the data were collected\n",
    "and the age structure in the setting we want to model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example to consider\n",
    "Let's try to adapt our mixing matrix from the United Kingdom data from the\n",
    "POLYMOD study to the age structure of the population of India.\n",
    "In one sense, this is not a good example, because there are such \n",
    "huge cultural differences between these two settings other than just \n",
    "the population distribution.\n",
    "However, there are also major differences in the population distribution,\n",
    "so this example should illustrate that consideration well."
